/* Debug celsius converter
Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to convert fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.

Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.

To convert fahrenheit to celsius:

celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9) */










public class GrassHopper {

    public static String weatherInfo(double temp) {
        double c = convertToCelsius(temp);
        if (c <= 0)
            return (c + " is freezing temperature");
        else
            return (c + " is above freezing temperature");
    }

    public static double convertToCelsius(double temperature) {
        double celsius = (temperature - 32) * 5/9;
        return celsius;
    }
}
